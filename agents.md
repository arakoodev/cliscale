# Agents Summary — Full Retrospective (Updated: Helm Migration + Security Review)

> This is the candid history of how the "ephemeral CLI agent" stack evolved: what we tried, what broke, how we scaled, what we secured, and what's still left to do. It includes the switch to **PostgreSQL (Cloud SQL)** for sessions/JTIs, the **WS Gateway** tier, **RS256/JWKS**, an **end-to-end Firebase Auth web demo**, the **Helm migration**, **Skaffold deployment**, and a **comprehensive security review**.

## 2) Pain Points / Lessons Learned

### 2.1 WebSockets & Scale

* Don't stream via `kubectl attach`/API-server: it's a **hard choke point** beyond a few thousand concurrent sockets.
* **In-pod ttyd** is the right primitive: traffic is client → gateway → pod, **not** through the control plane.
* **WS Gateway** must be **stateless**: verify JWT and look up `{sessionId→podIP}` in the DB; then plain TCP proxy.
* Memory budgeting: ~30–60 KB/idle WS across the gateway tier; plan ~40–60 GB for ~1M idle sockets spread across 40–80 pods.
* GCLB needs **long timeouts** and **pings**; set BackendConfig `timeoutSec ≥ 3600` and client heartbeats.

### 2.2 Control Plane & Pod Churn

* Avoid per-session Services/Ingress. Pod IP discovery via labels (or DB) is simpler and cheaper.
* Use Job `ttlSecondsAfterFinished`, sensible backoff, and `activeDeadlineSeconds` to avoid scheduler stress.

### 2.3 Security

* **Identity ≠ Capability**: Firebase ID token proves *who*. **Session-JWT** (short-lived, one-time) proves *who + which session*.
* **RS256 + JWKS** lets any tier verify tokens independently; easy rotation later via KMS.
* Lock down runner pods with **NetworkPolicies**: allow ingress only from gateway; restrict egress to Anthropic + artifact hosts.
* Verify artifacts: **domain allowlist**, **SHA-256**, size limits; defend against tarbombs.
* **Label consistency matters**: Runner pods must use Kubernetes standard labels (`app.kubernetes.io/name`) for network policies to work.
* **Connection pooling is critical**: Both controller and gateway need database connection pool limits to prevent exhaustion.

### 2.4 State & Consistency

* We replaced Redis with **PostgreSQL** for sessions/JTIs:
  * **UNLOGGED** tables for speed (ephemeral state) + expiry triggers for opportunistic cleanup.
  * Works well with gateway/controller replicas and token one-time-use semantics.

### 2.5 DX & Delivery

* Cloud Build cold starts are acceptable for the benefit of **no local Docker** and reproducibility.
* Keep runner image generic; pull CLI bundle at runtime to reduce rebuild frequency.
* **Skaffold + Helm** delivers true App Engine-like experience: `skaffold run` builds, pushes, and deploys in one command.
* **Helm charts** eliminate configuration drift between environments.

### 2.6 Migration & Security Review Lessons

* **Don't trust unverified developers** for life-critical systems - comprehensive review is essential.
* **Raw K8s manifests vs Helm**: Maintaining two sources of truth (k8s/ and Helm) creates dangerous drift.
* **Code verification matters**: Even good configs can have implementation bugs (e.g., label mismatches).
* **Security contexts must be consistent**: Controller and gateway should have identical hardening.
* **Health checks should verify dependencies**: Don't just return "ok" - actually check database connectivity.

### 2.7 Database Migrations & Testing

* **Raw SQL files vs migration tools**: `db/schema.sql` worked initially but created versioning problems.
* **Knex.js migrations** provide version control, rollback capability, and idempotent execution.
* **Helm pre-install hooks** are perfect for migrations: run once before deployment, safe to retry.
* **Smoke tests must test full lifecycle**: Syntax checks miss runtime errors like "Called end on pool more than once".
* **GitHub CI with PostgreSQL service**: Real database testing catches issues that mocks miss.
* **Skaffold + Helm integration**: Automatic migrations with `wait: true` means no manual intervention needed.

---

## 3) What Went Well

* **Stage-wise CLI** (listr2, ora, chalk, boxen) renders beautifully both in terminal and browser via ttyd.
* **Ephemeral Job** model + TTL keeps infra tidy and costs bounded.
* **Auth layering** (Firebase + session-JWT) is easy to reason about and audit.
* **WS Gateway** + **Postgres** delivers simple, scalable lookup + proxy logic.
* **End-to-end demo** with Firebase web app makes the value obvious and debuggable.
* **Helm migration** succeeded: Single source of truth, parameterized configs, environment profiles.
* **Skaffold integration** delivers promised App Engine-like UX: `skaffold run` → deployed.
* **Security review** caught critical issues before production: network policy bugs, missing configs, deployment workflow issues.
* **Code verification** found and fixed implementation bugs that config review missed.
* **Knex.js migrations** with Helm hooks: Zero-downtime, automatic, idempotent database schema updates.
* **Comprehensive smoke tests** in CI: Catch runtime errors (like double pool.destroy()) that unit tests miss.
* **PostgreSQL in GitHub CI**: Fast, free, reliable database testing without Docker complexity.

### P0 — Now (For Production)

* **Secret management automation** - Use External Secrets Operator or Google Secret Manager integration (documented in DEPLOYMENT.md)
* **KMS-backed RS256 signing** for session-JWTs; publish JWKS via controller; add key rotation policy
* **Stronger DB cleanup**: add `pg_cron` (e.g., minutely) to prune `sessions`/`token_jti` by `expires_at`
* **Cloud Armor** baseline (rate-limit `POST /api/sessions`, WAF, basic bot rules)
* **Monitoring & alerting** - Add Prometheus ServiceMonitors, Grafana dashboards, alerting rules
* **Disaster recovery documentation** - Backup procedures, RTO/RPO, restore runbooks

### P1 — Next

* **Observability**: metrics—open WS, job spin-up latency, gateway CPU/mem/sockets, CLI stage durations; SLOs & alerts
* **Backpressure/quotas**: per-user session caps; graceful queueing if the cluster is saturated
* **Artifact scanning**: MIME/type checks, AV/heuristics scan, max archive size, and extraction sandbox
* **Pod anti-affinity rules** - Spread replicas across nodes/zones for HA
* **Update ingress annotations** - Replace deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` with `spec.ingressClassName`

### P2 — Soon

* **Autoscaling**: HPA on gateway with custom metric `open_ws_connections`; KEDA ScaledJobs if we adopt a queued dispatcher
* **Multi-region** active/active: replicate only session metadata needed for routing; DNS-based client affinity
* **Runner hardening**: Continued improvements (already strong: runAsNonRoot, capabilities drop, seccomp profile)
* **Separate infrastructure and application Terraform** - Reduce blast radius, enable different update cadences

## 8) Deployment Quick Reference

### From Desktop (App Engine-like)
```bash
skaffold run --default-repo=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/apps --profile=staging
```

### Dev Mode with Live Reload
```bash
skaffold dev --port-forward
```

### From Cloud Build (CI/CD)
```bash
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml
```

### Via Terraform (Infrastructure + Application)
```bash
cd infra && terraform apply
```

### Appendix A — Capacity Cheatsheet

* **Gateway sockets**: ~30–60 KB per idle WS; 1M sockets ⇒ ~40–60 GB across 40–80 pods.
* **BackendConfig**: `timeoutSec: 3600–7200`; send WS pings.
* **Runner**: size for your CLI; set `activeDeadlineSeconds`; use `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` to reclaim quickly.
* **Database connections**: Controller + Gateway combined: ~40 connections per replica at max (20 each).

### Appendix B — Threat Model Highlights

* **Token theft** → short-lived **RS256 JWT** (verified via **JWKS** at edge) + **JTI one-time use** (in Postgres) + TLS.
* **Tarbomb/RCE** → checksum + allowlist + size limits + safe extraction; runner script hardened.
* **Pod pivot** → default-deny egress; non-root; capabilities drop; seccomp profile; network policies with correct labels.
* **Network isolation** → NetworkPolicies ensure runner pods only accept connections from gateway on port 7681.
* **Resource exhaustion** → ResourceQuota and LimitRange enabled; connection pool limits configured.

### Appendix C — Migration Milestones

1. **Oct 21**: Raw K8s manifests (k8s/ directory)
2. **Oct 22**: Helm chart migration (cliscale-chart/ directory)
3. **Oct 22**: Skaffold integration (skaffold.yaml)
4. **Oct 22**: Security review & fixes (24/29 issues resolved)
5. **Oct 22**: Code verification (runner labels, health checks, pooling)
6. **Oct 26**: Knex.js migrations + Helm hooks + CI smoke tests

---

**Bottom line:** We now have a **production-ready architecture** with:
- ✅ Helm-managed Kubernetes deployments
- ✅ Skaffold for App Engine-like deployment UX (`skaffold run` → automatic migrations → deployed)
- ✅ All critical security issues resolved (9/9)
- ✅ Code-verified implementation (health checks, security contexts, network policies)
- ✅ **Automatic database migrations** - Helm pre-install/pre-upgrade hooks with Knex.js
- ✅ **Full lifecycle testing** - GitHub CI with PostgreSQL service and smoke tests
- ✅ **Zero-downtime deployments** - Migrations complete before pods restart
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (DEPLOYMENT.md, MIGRATIONS_K8S.md, HELM_PLAN.md)
- ✅ **Approved for staging deployment**

The remaining work is operational (monitoring, DR documentation, rate limiting) - the core system is secure and ready to use.
