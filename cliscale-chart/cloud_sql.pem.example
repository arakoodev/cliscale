-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
[Your Cloud SQL Server Certificate Here]
This certificate is required for secure SSL/TLS connections to Google Cloud SQL.

To obtain this certificate:

1. Via Google Cloud Console:
   - Go to Cloud SQL Instances
   - Select your instance
   - Go to "Connections" tab
   - Under "Configure SSL", download the server certificate
   - Save as cloud_sql.pem

2. Via gcloud CLI:
   gcloud sql ssl-certs describe server-ca \
     --instance=YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME \
     --format="value(cert)" > cloud_sql.pem

3. The certificate is then mounted to pods via Kubernetes secrets

Note: This is a public server certificate (not a private key), but it's
specific to your Cloud SQL instance, so keep it out of version control.

If using a different database (not Cloud SQL), you may not need this file.
Check your values.yaml db.sslMode configuration.
