-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
[Your RS256 Public Key Here]
This is used by the gateway to verify JWT tokens signed by the controller.

To generate a new key pair:
1. Generate private key:
   openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048

2. Extract public key:
   openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem

3. Copy both files to this directory:
   - private.pem (used by controller, keep secret)
   - public.pem (used by gateway for verification)

Note: The public key can be safely shared and is mounted to both controller
and gateway pods via Kubernetes secrets.
