This chart renders one set of resources per top-level service block in values.yaml (e.g., controller, frontend, gateway).
Each block supports: image, replicaCount, resources, env/envFrom, probes, volumes, initContainers, sidecars,
service (with extraPorts), ingress, autoscaling (HPA), pdb, networkPolicy, and many pod-level knobs.
